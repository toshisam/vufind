     * GH 12.3.2015:
     * we need this snippet because of the custom attribute data-searchClass
     * data-searchClass is used for the export function which depends on the SearchClass in case of multiple tabs
     * compare: https://github.com/swissbib/vufind/issues/232
     * we have to think about better solutions with no relation to any semantics and annotations
     * at the moment we need a solution for going public
     * Think about:
     * - discussion with list (do they support a bulk export for the result list (I guess not at the moment)
     * - more effective css selectors to search for the correct elements within the DOM structure
     * ...
